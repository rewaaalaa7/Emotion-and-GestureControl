# Gesture-Based Smart Presentation Assistant

## Overview
The Gesture-Based Smart Presentation Assistant is an advanced Python application designed to control PowerPoint or Google Slides presentations through hand gestures and facial authentication. Utilizing computer vision and machine learning, the system authenticates presenters, enables gesture-based slide navigation, and provides real-time feedback. Additional features include webcam calibration for accuracy and an optional emotion-based pause mechanism, enhancing the interactivity and accessibility of presentations.

## Key Features
- **Facial Authentication**: Verifies presenter identity using DeepFace or MediaPipe Face Mesh, ensuring secure control access.
- **Gesture-Based Control**: Supports four hand gestures (Next Slide, Previous Slide, Start Presentation, End Presentation) via MediaPipe Hands.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays presenter name and gesture status (e.g., "Next Slide âœ”") on-screen for seamless interaction.
- **Camera Calibration**: Employs OpenCV with a chessboard pattern to calibrate the webcam, minimizing distortion and enhancing gesture detection.
- **Emotion-Based Pause (Optional)**: Detects presenter confusion through facial emotion analysis, pausing the presentation with a "Paused due to confusion" message until expression change.
- **Bonus Features (Planned)**:
  - Voice feedback for gesture actions (e.g., "Next slide activated").
  - Integration with PowerPoint API or browser automation tools.
  - Customizable gesture training mode.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam (built-in or external)
- PowerPoint or Google Slides installed
- Chessboard pattern image for calibration

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rewaaalaa7/Gesture-Based-Smart-Presentation-Assistant.git
   cd Gesture-Based-Smart-Presentation-Assistant

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. **Calibrate the Webcam**:
   ```bash
   python calibrate_camera.py
2. **Launch the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Operation

### Authentication
- Position your face in front of the webcam for identity verification.

### Gestures
- **Next Slide:** Extend index and middle fingers (others folded).
- **Previous Slide:** Extend little finger (others folded).
- **Start Presentation:** Open palm facing camera.
- **End Presentation:** Closed fist.
- **Feedback:** Presenter name and gesture status appear on-screen.
- **Emotion-Pause (Optional):** Presentation pauses if confusion is detected, resuming upon expression change.
- **Exit:** Press `q` to exit.

##  Configuration
- Modify gesture thresholds or webcam settings in `main.py` for optimal performance.
- Ensure adequate lighting and a clear view of your face and hands for accurate detection.
